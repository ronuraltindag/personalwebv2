I'll run the Sugarloaf Marathon on May 14, 2023 to honor the victims and fundraise for the survivors of the devastating earthquakes in southern Turkey. 
Please consider supporting.

Thank you to everyone who supported the fundraising effort for the earthquake victims in Turkey. I finished the Sugarloaf Marathon in 3:21 on a tough, mountainous course with truly incredible views. Running this race with such a meaningful cause in mind made the experience even more special. Together, we raised $5,165 to support those affected by the earthquake.
