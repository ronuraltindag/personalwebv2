  I am an applied microeconomist studying how public policies and institutional context shape health, economic security, and organizational outcomes. My research combines quasi-experimental methods with large-scale field experiments conducted in collaboration with public institutions and international organizations.
  
  I am an invited researcher with [J-PAL and IPA's Displaced Livelihoods Initiative (DLI)](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative/displaced-livelihoods-initiative-dli) and the [Humanitarian Protection Initiative (HPI)](https://poverty-action.org/humanitarian-protection-initiative), and a Research Fellow at the [IZA Institute of Labor Economics](https://www.iza.org/).
  
  I spent most of my early life in Turkey, where I completed my undergraduate studies in economics at [Galatasaray University](https://gsu.edu.tr/en). I subsequently pursued a master's degree at the [University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/). I received my PhD in Economics from the [City University of New York](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/) in 2016 and then held a David E. Bell Postdoctoral Fellowship at the [Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population-development/) prior to joining [Bentley University](https://www.bentley.edu/) in 2017.
