intro: |
 I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at [Bentley University](https://www.bentley.edu/). My research interests center around population health, migration, and economic development. A recurring theme in my work involves the study of economically vulnerable populations. I use both experimental and quasi-experimental methods to conduct research. I frequently collaborate with local institutions by either using their administrative data or partnering with them to collect data and design interventions to inform policy. On this site, all of my academic publications, working papers, and replication packages are available, provided that de-identified data can be made available.
