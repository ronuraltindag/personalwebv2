intro: |
 I am an Associate Professor of Economics at [Bentley University](https://www.bentley.edu/). My research interests center around population health, migration, and economic development. A recurring theme in my work involves the study of economically vulnerable populations. I use both experimental and quasi-experimental methods to conduct research. I frequently collaborate with local institutions by either  partnering with them to collect data and design interventions or using their administrative data to inform policy. On this site, you can find all of my academic publications, working papers, and replication packages, provided that de-identified data can be made public.
