### Abstract 

**Objectives**. To describe demographic characteristics and abortion timing of minors in
Arkansas who obtained an abortion through a judicial bypass, and to contrast the frequency of judicial bypass in other states in the United States.



**Methods**.We used individual-level data on all abortions to minors (n = 2624) performed
in Arkansas from 2005 to 2014 and aggregated data from 10 additional states on
abortions obtained through a judicial bypass. We characterized correlates of the judicial
bypass and its association with the timing of abortion.
Results. Minors in Arkansas who used the courts were more likely to be 17 years of age,
nonresidents of Arkansas, Hispanic, and with fewer previous pregnancies than their
younger, resident, non-Hispanic White, and multigravida counterparts; 7.7% of abortions
to minors were obtained via a bypass in 11 states, but only 2% if Texas and Arkansas are
excluded.

**Conclusions**. The demographics of minors who obtain an abortion through a judicial
bypass differ significantly from those who have parental consent, and there is widespread
variation in the proportion of bypass cases across states.
